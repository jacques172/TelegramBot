I've developed a Telegram bot that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to help write personalized cover letters for college applications

🔍 How it Works: The bot asks a series of questions, like your educational background, career aspirations, and why you're interested in a particular field. Then, it generates a suitable cover letter from your answers.
